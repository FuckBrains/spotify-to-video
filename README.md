# spotify-to-video
Spotify-to-video is a program made in python. Basic concept is that you put spotify playlist link tweek few settings and you get .mp4 music videos (or 1 video) of songs from that playlist.  
I use it when i like to sing songs that i do not know the text of.


# Usage
If you are not intrested in python file only in program i suggest downloading .sfx file. That is all you need to run the program.  
First of all I want you to know that every time i run this program my antywirus triggers and I don't know why, so don't be scared haha.
